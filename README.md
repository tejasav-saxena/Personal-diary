# Personal Diary Application

A simple GUI-based Personal Diary application built using Python and `Tkinter`. This app allows users to write, save, load, and clear diary entries. Entries are saved based on the current date and username.

## Features

- **Username Prompt**: The app asks for a username at the start and uses it to personalize the diary entry filenames.
- **Save Entry**: Save your diary entry for the current day.
- **Load Entry**: Load the saved entry for the current day.
- **Clear Text**: Clear the current diary text from the text box.
- **Responsive Design**: The application layout adjusts to window resizing.
